# Language_Translator_IBM_Cloud

This exercise provides the idea how to use Speech to text and Language Translator service in IBM Cloud. At the beginning, I needed to create an instance for Language Translator service and another instance for Speech to text service. Then I needed to pull data through API(Application Program Interface) by providing API key and URL infromation extracted from the Speech to text and Language Translator service. Speech has been transformed through IBM Watson libraries, then it is translated to different languages through Language Translator service.
